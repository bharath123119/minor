Complete Process for Product Analysis Project
**1. Define the Objective**

Determine the goal: Understand product sales performance, customer behavior, and trends.

Identify key questions, such as:

Which products are top-selling?

How does pricing affect sales?

Are there seasonal trends in product demand?

**2. Data Collection**

Source data from available datasets (CSV, Excel, or database).

Ensure dataset includes relevant fields: Product ID, Category, Price, Sales Volume, Revenue, Date, etc.

For this project, you likely used Mobile Sales dataset.

**3. Data Cleaning & Preparation**

Handle missing values: Fill, drop, or impute missing data.

Remove duplicates to avoid biased analysis.

Standardize category labels to maintain consistency.

Validate numerical fields: Ensure sales, price, and revenue data are correct and in the proper format.

Convert dates to proper datetime format if needed.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA)

Understand the dataset using descriptive statistics (mean, median, max, min, standard deviation).

Analyze correlations between price, sales, and revenue.

Segment data by categories, brands, or regions.

Identify top-selling products, high-revenue contributors, and low-performing items.

Detect seasonal or monthly trends in sales.

**5. Data Analysis Tools & Techniques**

Python: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

SQL: To query datasets, aggregate sales, and calculate metrics like total revenue per product.

Excel: For cleaning, basic pivot tables, and simple visualizations.

Power BI / Tableau: For dashboards and interactive visualizations.
**
**6. Data Visualization****

Create bar charts for top-selling products.

Use line charts for monthly/seasonal sales trends.

Heatmaps to visualize correlations.

Dashboards showing key metrics:

Total sales by product/category

Revenue contribution per product

Trend analysis over time

**7. Insights & Recommendations**

Identify products contributing most to revenue.

Highlight seasonal peaks and low-demand periods.

Recommend business actions:

Adjust pricing or promotions

Focus marketing on high-performing categories

Reduce stock or promotion on low-performing items
**
**8. Documentation & Reporting****

Document all SQL queries, Python scripts, and analysis steps.

Provide clear visualizations and explanations in dashboards or notebooks.

Ensure the project is reproducible for others reviewing your GitHub repo.
